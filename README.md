# 🔧 CysawTool

> \[!NOTE]
> On the Cysaw Discord, they say:
> *“Do not try to bypass ads or use automated tools. This may result in temporary access restrictions. Please use the website normally through your browser.”*
>
> The reality is they **can’t detect** this tool — it’s highly advanced and designed to avoid detection. So don’t worry, you won’t get banned from the website.
> And if Cysaw releases an update, the tool will be updated within 30 minutes! (Or much if its by night, my time code: https://time.is/Paris)
